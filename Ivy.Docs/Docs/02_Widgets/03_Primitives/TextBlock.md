# TextBlock

The TextBlock widget displays text content with customizable styling. It's a fundamental building block for creating user interfaces with text, supporting various formatting options and layout properties.

This widget is rarely used directly. Instead, use the helper class `Ivy.Helpers.Text` which provides a more user-friendly API for creating text elements.
